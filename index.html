          <h2>What is yoga and how does it work?</h2>
            <p>Yoga is an ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian philosophy. It began as a spiritual practice but has become popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being.</p>
            <p>There are many different yoga styles, ranging from gentle practices to physically demanding ones. Differences in the types of yoga used in research studies may affect study results. This makes it challenging to evaluate research on the health effects of yoga.</p>

          <h2>What are the health benefits of yoga?</h2>
            <ul> <b>Research suggests that yoga may:</b>
              <li>Help improve general wellness by relieving stress, supporting good health habits, and improving mental/emotional health, sleep, and balance.</li>
              <li>Relieve low-back pain and neck pain, and possibly pain from tension-type headaches and knee osteoarthritis.</li>
              <li>Help people who are overweight or obese lose weight.</li>
              <li>Help people quit smoking.</li>
              <li>Help people manage anxiety or depressive symptoms associated with difficult life situations.</li>
              <li>Relieve menopause symptoms.</li>
              <li>Help people with chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although there's been a lot of research on the health effects of yoga, many studies have included only small numbers of people and haven’t been of high quality. Therefore, in most instances, we can only say that yoga has shown promise for particular health uses, not that it’s been proven to help.</p>
